    <p>My favorite Hobby is reading!<br> Why? Well because reading is great! <br> You can escape to another world by just sitting down and picking up a great book. I love all kinds of books and read all the time! My family always tell me that I read to much. But then they don't really mind that I read. <br>My whole family love reading and since we're homeschooled we get to read often. <br> Reading can also teach you many things. I know that when I started reading I started spelling better and started learning more things and I could start doing more school work by myself!<br>I just LOVE reading!! I even write books because of how much I believe that reading can be fun and teach you something.</p><br><br>
